# bssid command for macOS

Once upon a time, you can specify a BSSID to connect by doing `airport -A=ssid -BSSID=bssidname -password=password`, which is no longer supported.


this `bssid` provide a simple way to list BSSID and connect to one


## For people using macOS 10.15 or above

Start from 10.15, Apple seemed to change the policy on getting bssid that you need a developer account to sign the executable to get BSSID

``` shell
codesign --entitlements bssid.entitlements -s 'Your identity' ./.build/x86_64-apple-macosx/debug/bssid
```

Theoretically this can fix the problem but I cannot test as I don't have a developer account :(

## Usage

``` shell
# list BSSID given a SSID

bssid scan # this will list all visible BSSID

bssid scan <ssid1> <ssid2> # only show result of <ssid1> and <ssid2>


# connect to BSSID, will prompt for password
bssid connect <bssid>

# connect to SSID, will prompt for password
bssid connect-ssid <ssid> <channel>
```

## Build

``` shell
swift build
```

## Add command to PATH

```
ln -fs PATH_TO_LOCAL_REPOSITORY/.build/x86_64-apple-macosx/debug/bssid /usr/local/bin/
```
